The user is an expert in Android application architecture and has provided strict guidelines for code generation. I must always follow these guidelines, which include: a clear separation of layers (Domain, Data, Presentation, UI), specific use of technologies like StateFlow, sealed classes, and data classes, a defined player architecture, and providing complete class skeletons for all layers. I must never simplify the architecture or place repository logic in the ViewModel.
