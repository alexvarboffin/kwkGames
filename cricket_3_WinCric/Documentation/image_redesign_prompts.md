# Prompts for AI Image Generation: Redesign

This document provides prompts for an AI image generator to create redesigned versions of the application's background and splash screen images. The goal is to generate new, unique visuals without using the original images as a base.

### 1. Game Background (replaces `ic_game_background.jpg`)

**Objective:** Create a vibrant and atmospheric background for the main gameplay screen. The image should be exciting and draw the player into the world of a professional cricket match.

**Prompt:**
"A breathtaking, ultra-wide panoramic digital painting of a packed cricket stadium at dusk. The sky is a dramatic mix of deep purples, oranges, and blues. The stadium lights are just turning on, casting long, dramatic shadows on the perfectly manicured green field. The crowd is a blur of motion and color, creating a sense of immense energy. The style should be modern, clean, and slightly stylized, with a focus on dramatic lighting and atmosphere. No text or logos should be visible. The perspective should be from a high vantage point behind the batsman, in the style of Unreal Tournament '99."

### 2. Level Select Background (replaces `ic_level_select_background.jpg`)

**Objective:** Design a charming and creative background for the level selection screen that feels like a journey.

**Prompt:**
"A top-down, hand-drawn illustration of a vintage-style treasure map for a cricket adventure. The background is a textured parchment paper. A dotted line path winds across the map, connecting different cricket-themed landmarks that represent the levels: a crossed pair of cricket bats, a cricket helmet, a wicket, a trophy, etc. The title 'Level Select' is written in a playful, hand-drawn font at the top. The overall style should be charming, whimsical, and slightly rustic, with a warm, inviting color palette, in the style of Unreal Tournament '99."

### 3. Main Menu Background (replaces `ic_main_background.jpg`)

**Objective:** Generate a clean, abstract, and modern background for the game's main menu. It should be visually interesting but not distracting.

**Prompt:**
"A minimalistic and elegant abstract background with a subtle sports theme. A deep blue and silver color palette. The design should feature clean, sweeping curves that suggest the trajectory of a cricket ball, intersecting with a faint, glowing hexagonal pattern reminiscent of a net or modern tech. The lighting should be soft and ambient, with a gentle glow emanating from the intersecting lines. The overall feel should be premium, modern, and high-tech, in the style of Unreal Tournament '99."

### 4. Splash Screen (replaces `ic_splashscreen.png`)

**Objective:** Create an epic and dynamic splash screen that builds excitement as the game loads. It should feature a heroic player and a strong title treatment.

**Prompt:**
"An epic, action-focused splash screen for a cricket game titled 'ARENA MSTB'. A powerful fast bowler is captured in a dynamic, mid-action pose, just as the ball leaves his hand, with explosive energy and motion blur. The scene is set in a packed stadium at night, with dramatic, cinematic lighting. The game title, 'ARENA MSTB', should be rendered in a bold, modern, metallic 3D font, integrated into the scene with sparks and light effects. The style should be hyper-realistic and intense, similar to a modern video game cover, in the style of Unreal Tournament '99."
